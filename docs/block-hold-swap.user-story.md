# User Story: Block Hold and Swap Mechanic

## Title
Implement Block Hold and Swap Mechanic for Enhanced Gameplay Strategy

## As a
Player who wants more strategic options and advanced gameplay

## I want
To be able to store the current tetromino (block) and swap it with a previously stored block during gameplay

## So that
I can plan ahead, recover from difficult situations, and use advanced strategies to improve my score and enjoyment

## Description
Currently, players must use each tetromino as it appears. The new requirement is to allow players to hold the current tetromino in a storage slot and swap it with the stored block at any time (with appropriate restrictions, e.g., only once per drop). This mechanic is common in modern Tetris games and adds a layer of strategy, enabling players to save useful pieces for later or escape tricky board states. The UI should clearly display the held block, and controls should be intuitive and accessible.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Player can press a designated key (e.g., Shift or configurable) to store the current tetromino
- If a block is already stored, pressing the key swaps the current and stored blocks
- Player can only swap once per tetromino drop (cannot repeatedly swap without placing a block)
- The held block is visually displayed in the game UI
- All controls remain responsive and accessible
- Feature is covered by unit, integration, and E2E tests
- Accessibility and keyboard navigation are maintained
- Documentation is updated to reflect new controls and mechanic

## Code Quality Requirements
- Follow project coding standards and TypeScript strict mode
- Use proper types and interfaces for hold/swap logic and state
- Ensure code is modular, maintainable, and well-documented
- Add JSDoc for new functions and interfaces
- Update or add tests for new and changed logic

## Feature Requirements
- Update input handling to support hold/swap action
- Implement hold/swap logic in the game engine and state
- Restrict swaps to once per drop
- Update UI to display held block and swap status
- Ensure compatibility with multiplayer mode
- Add configuration for hold/swap key

## Use Cases & Scenarios
- Player presses hold key: current block moves to hold slot, next block appears
- Player swaps with held block: held block becomes active, current block moves to hold slot
- Player cannot swap again until after placing a block
- Player uses hold/swap in multiplayer mode
- Player uses hold/swap with accessibility features enabled
- Player changes hold/swap key in settings

## Test Cases
- Unit: Hold/swap logic updates state correctly
- Unit: Swap restriction enforced per drop
- Integration: Input handling triggers hold/swap
- Integration: Hold/swap works in multiplayer
- E2E: Player can hold, swap, and play as expected
- E2E: Accessibility and keyboard navigation are preserved
- Performance: No input lag during hold/swap

## Documentation
- Update user guide and README with new hold/swap mechanic and controls
- Document configuration option for hold/swap key
- Update changelog with new feature
