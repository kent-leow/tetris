# User Story: Comprehensive Testing for Core Logic and End-to-End Flows

## Title
Ensure Complete Unit and E2E Test Coverage for Core Logic (Frontend & Backend)

## As a
Developer and QA engineer

## I want
All core game logic (engine, state management, scoring, collision, etc.) to be fully covered by unit tests, and all critical user flows to be covered by end-to-end (E2E) tests on both frontend and backend

## So that
I can ensure the reliability, correctness, and robustness of the game, and catch regressions or integration issues early

## Acceptance Criteria
- 100% unit test coverage for all core logic modules (game engine, state, scoring, collision, etc.)
- Unit tests are implemented for both frontend and backend logic
- E2E tests cover all major user flows (single player, two player, settings, leaderboard, etc.)
- E2E tests are implemented for both frontend (UI interactions) and backend (API endpoints)
- Tests include edge cases, error conditions, and performance scenarios
- All tests are automated and run in CI pipeline
- Test results and coverage reports are available and reviewed regularly

## Notes
- Use Jest for unit testing and React Testing Library for component tests
- Use Playwright or Cypress for E2E tests
- Mock external dependencies and services as needed
- Update documentation to reflect test coverage and testing strategy
