# User Story: Highscore Display on Menu

**As a player, I want to see my current highscore displayed on the main menu, so I can track my progress and achievements.**

## Acceptance Criteria
- The highscore is fetched from local storage and displayed prominently.
- If no highscore exists, show a default message (e.g., “No highscore yet”).
- The highscore updates after each game session.

## Tips
- Validate and sanitize score data before display.
- Use large, readable fonts for the highscore.
- Announce highscore changes for screen readers.
