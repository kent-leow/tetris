# User Story: Deploy Full Stack Tetris App to Vercel

## Title
Deploy Tetris Frontend, Backend, and Database to Vercel with Global Access

## As a
Developer

## I want
To deploy the entire Tetris application (frontend, backend API, and database) to Vercel, and allow website access from any domain (www)

## So that
Users worldwide can access and play the game seamlessly, with a fully managed deployment and global reach

## Description
This story covers the deployment of the Tetris app, including the Next.js frontend, API routes (backend), and MongoDB database, to Vercel. The deployment should ensure that the site is accessible from any www domain, with proper CORS configuration for APIs. The process should follow project coding, security, and performance standards.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] The Next.js frontend is deployed to Vercel and accessible globally
- [x] API routes (backend) are deployed and functional on Vercel
- [x] MongoDB database is provisioned and connected (using Vercel integration or external managed instance)
- [x] All environment variables are securely set in Vercel dashboard
- [x] CORS is configured to allow access from any www domain
- [x] The deployed site is accessible from www and non-www domains
- [x] Deployment is automated via Vercel Git integration
- [x] Documentation is updated with deployment steps and configuration
- [x] Security and performance best practices are followed

## Code Quality Requirements
- Follow all project coding standards (see coding.instructions.md)
- Use TypeScript strict mode and proper types
- Ensure code is modular, maintainable, and well-documented
- Follow SOLID and functional programming principles
- Include JSDoc for public functions and interfaces

## Feature Requirements
- Vercel deployment for both frontend and backend (API routes)
- MongoDB database connection (Vercel integration or external)
- CORS configuration for API routes to allow www access
- Environment variable management in Vercel
- Automated deployment from GitHub
- Documentation of deployment process

## Use Cases & Scenarios
- User visits the deployed site from www.example.com and non-www.example.com
- API requests from any www domain are accepted and processed
- Database operations (high scores, settings) work in production
- Developer can redeploy via GitHub push
- Environment variables are updated securely without code changes
- Site is accessible globally with low latency

## Test Cases
- Deploy to Vercel and verify site loads from www and non-www domains
- Test API endpoints from different origins (www, non-www)
- Test database read/write in production
- Test CORS headers in API responses
- Test redeployment via GitHub push
- Test environment variable changes without code redeploy
- Test performance and security (Core Web Vitals, CORS, etc.)

## Documentation
- Update README with deployment instructions
- Document Vercel configuration (build, output, env vars)
- Document CORS setup for API routes
- Document MongoDB connection for production
- Add troubleshooting and FAQ for deployment
