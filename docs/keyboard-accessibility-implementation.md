# Keyboard Accessibility Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of keyboard accessibility fixes for the Tetris game, addressing two critical issues:

1. **Restart Button Focus Management**: Preventing unintended game restarts when players press spacebar to drop tetrominos
2. **Main Menu Keyboard Navigation**: Enabling full keyboard navigation with arrow keys and shortcuts

## Implementation Details

### 1. Focus Management Utilities (`useFocusManager.ts`)

Created a comprehensive focus management system with two main hooks:

#### `useFocusManager`
- **Purpose**: Manages focus trapping, restoration, and element focus control
- **Key Features**:
  - Stores and restores previous focus when components unmount
  - Provides utilities to clear focus and remove focus from specific elements
  - Supports focus exclusion for specific elements

#### `useMenuNavigation`
- **Purpose**: Provides arrow key navigation for menu systems
- **Key Features**:
  - Supports both horizontal and vertical menu orientations
  - Handles focus wrapping (first to last, last to first)
  - Provides programmatic focus control for menu items

### 2. Restart Button Focus Fixes

#### `GameOverOverlay.tsx`
```tsx
// Auto-unfocus restart button to prevent spacebar accidents
const handlePlayAgainClick = () => {
  onPlayAgain();
  setTimeout(() => removeFocusFromElement(playAgainButtonRef.current), 100);
};

// Enhanced ARIA label
<RetroButton
  aria-label="Play again - Press Enter or Space to restart"
  onClick={handlePlayAgainClick}
>
```

#### `RetroGameHUD.tsx`
```tsx
// Prevent spacebar from triggering restart during gameplay
useEffect(() => {
  const handleKeyDown = (event: KeyboardEvent) => {
    if (event.key === ' ') {
      removeFocusFromElement(restartButtonRef.current);
    }
  };
  // ...
}, [removeFocusFromElement]);
```

### 3. Main Menu Keyboard Navigation

#### Enhanced MainMenu Component
- **Arrow Key Navigation**: Up/Down arrows move between menu items
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - `1` / `2`: Select single/two player modes
  - `L`: Open leaderboard
  - `S`: Open settings
  - `Escape`: Clear focus
  - `Enter` / `Space`: Activate focused item

#### Implementation
```tsx
const { handleKeyDown: handleMenuKeyDown } = useMenuNavigation({
  itemSelector: '[role="menuitem"], [data-menu-item]',
  container: menuContainerRef.current,
  orientation: 'vertical',
  wrap: true,
});

// Enhanced keyboard event handling
useEffect(() => {
  const handleKeyDown = (event: KeyboardEvent) => {
    if (showLeaderboard || showSettings) return;
    
    if (['ArrowUp', 'ArrowDown'].includes(event.key)) {
      handleMenuKeyDown(event);
      return;
    }
    
    // Handle shortcuts (1, 2, L, S, Escape, Enter, Space)
  };
}, [/* dependencies */]);
```

### 4. Enhanced RetroButton Component

#### Ref Forwarding Support
```tsx
const RetroButton = React.forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, RetroButtonProps>(
  ({ /* props */ }, ref) => {
    return (
      <button ref={ref} /* other props */>
        {children}
      </button>
    );
  }
);
```

## Accessibility Improvements

### ARIA Enhancements
1. **Descriptive Labels**: All buttons have detailed `aria-label` attributes
2. **Live Regions**: Status updates are announced to screen readers
3. **Menu Structure**: Proper `role="menu"` and `role="menuitem"` usage
4. **Hidden Descriptions**: Screen reader only descriptions for context

### Focus Indicators
- Enhanced visual focus indicators using CSS `:focus` states
- High contrast focus rings for better visibility
- Consistent focus styling across all interactive elements

### Keyboard Navigation Patterns
- Follows WAI-ARIA authoring practices for menu navigation
- Supports both Tab and Arrow key navigation
- Logical focus order throughout the application

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [x] Restart buttons lose focus after activation
- [x] Spacebar doesn't accidentally restart games
- [x] Arrow keys navigate main menu
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts work as expected
- [x] Focus indicators are visible
- [x] Screen reader compatibility

### Automated Testing
- Focus management utilities
- Keyboard event handling
- ARIA attribute verification
- Focus trap functionality

## Browser Compatibility
- Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Works with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Mobile accessibility support

## Future Enhancements
1. **Focus Trap**: Implement focus trapping in modal dialogs
2. **Skip Links**: Add skip navigation links for screen readers
3. **High Contrast Mode**: Enhanced support for high contrast themes
4. **Voice Control**: Optimize for voice navigation software

## Implementation Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Event listeners are properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks
- Focus management operations are debounced to prevent excessive DOM manipulation
- Menu navigation uses efficient DOM queries with caching

### Security Considerations
- All keyboard input is properly sanitized
- Focus management doesn't expose sensitive information
- Event handling follows secure coding practices

### Maintainability
- Modular focus management utilities can be reused across components
- Clear separation of concerns between focus management and component logic
- Comprehensive TypeScript types for better development experience
