## Title
Refactor the Tetris UI to Adopt an Old School Retro Feeling

## As a
Player who enjoys classic arcade games

The Tetris game interface to have an old school retro look and feel, reminiscent of classic arcade and console games from the 80s and 90s

I can experience nostalgia and enjoy a visually authentic retro gaming experience

## Acceptance Criteria
