 * □ Enter key works properly for restart actions
 * □ Tab navigation works correctly around restart buttons
 * □ Focus indicators are visible on restart buttons
 * 
 * Main Menu Keyboard Navigation:
 * □ Arrow keys move focus between menu items
 * □ Enter/Space activates the selected menu item

 * □ 1/2 keys select single/two player modes
 * □ L key opens leaderboard
 * □ S key opens settings
 * □ Escape key clears focus
 * □ Visual focus indicators are present and clear
 * □ Screen reader announces menu items correctly
 * □ ARIA labels provide context for each action
 * 
 * Game Mode Selection:
 * □ Arrow keys work within game mode selection
 * □ Enter/Space activates game mode selection
 * □ Focus wraps around correctly
 * □ Selected mode is announced clearly
 * 
 * Accessibility Standards:
 * □ All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
 * □ Focus order is logical and predictable
 * □ Focus is trapped appropriately in modals
 * □ Focus returns to appropriate element when modals close

/**
 * Test Scenarios for Automation:
 * 
 * 1. Spacebar Restart Prevention:
 *    - Focus restart button in GameOverOverlay
 *    - Press spacebar
 *    - Verify button loses focus after 100ms
 *    - Verify onPlayAgain is called only once
 * 
 * 2. Menu Navigation:
 *    - Press arrow down on start button
 *    - Verify focus moves to leaderboard button
 *    - Press arrow up
 *    - Verify focus returns to start button
 * 
 * 3. Keyboard Shortcuts:
 *    - Press '1' key
 *    - Verify single player mode is selected
 *    - Press 'L' key
 *    - Verify leaderboard opens
 * 
 * 4. Focus Management:
 *    - Open settings with 'S' key
 *    - Close settings with Escape
 *    - Verify focus returns to settings button
